    CRWN Clothing App is specific project for me. I've wanted to learn as much as I can on that project that's why

    and I am going to implement to this project.

export const CartDemoECancelary = `
So, E-Cancelary was just a first start with Node.js backend. I wanted to look under another angle on fullstack apps. Lately I used to make such apps using Spring Boot (Java). But since I am quite better at JS rather than Java I've given it a try. I'm not quite fully satisfied about this app, it needs to be repaired but hey, I wasn't telling You that it is finished right?
